This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Konigle Frontend Task

- Powered by React, create-react-app, Materialize, React Router and Heroku
- In the sales menu, a very primitive pinning feature allows users to pin up to one card at a time, displaying the rest in the default order
- Unit tests with Enzyme (unfortunately neither TDD or BDD because I was not familiar with either of them)
- Strictly follows Airbnb's style guide, enforced by ESLint
